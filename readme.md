Angular Gulp build for Angular Ad Campaigns App
=================================================
CLI commands:
npm start - primary run method
npm build - just does a fresh build
gulp test - run tests
gulp clean - clean deploy folder
gulp build - build the dist
gulp start - start the servers if you want to start the app use "npm start"
gulp start-server - starts the API server

To run the application:
it is a bit tricky because I designed with assumption there is an API server
so to start the app please open terminal in the same directory as the project

**run:**<br/>
npm install<br/>
npm start<br/>

this will install all the requirements and then start the API server

Now when it loads the application should be available at<br/>
<a href="http://localhost:3000">http://localhost:3000</a>

**Needs work:**<br/>
Tests are broken but you can still read the file
